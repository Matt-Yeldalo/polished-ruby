# Testing to Ensure Your Code Works

* Due to Ruby's flexibility and dynamic typing nature, testing is more critical
compared to other languages.

```ruby
Dir['{dir}/**/*.rb'].each do |file|
  read, write = IO.pipe
  print '.'
  system('ruby', '-wc', '--disable-gems', file, out: write, err: write)
  write.close
  output = read.read
  unless output.chomp == "Syntax OK"
    puts
    puts output.sub(/Syntax OK\Z/, '')
  end
 end
```

## Test Approaches

* All approaches comes with trade-offs
* TDD (Test Driven Development)
write tests for your code before writing the code itself. Tests **Drive** the development.

* BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
the tests (specs) are written in a reduced from of English, possibly by a non-programmer.
Programmer writes test and writes code then repeat.

### TAD

* TAD (Test After Development)
start to add tests once the software is mostly working how you want. Work generally
well, probably the most popular.

* TAD is not without problems. You can end up implementing a feature that works,
but the interface to use it is hard to use or testing it is difficult

* Ensure that you constantly remind yourself of how the user will use the feature,
make sure to keep that usage as simple as you can

* Not following this may result in an *easier* implementation, but making testing
difficult.

### TDD

* TDD suffers from the opposite problem. You may end up designing interfaces that
are easy to test but hard to implement

* Needs when testing (mocked/stubbed objects) are often quite different than the needs of
the average user of the library
