## Symbols vs Strings

* Immedediate objects are faster than non-immediate objects

* Confusion probably comes due to popular rails methods using `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess`.
This allows you to use either symbols or strings.

* String = series of chracters or bytes

* Symbol = a number with an attached inditifier that is a series of characters or bytes

* Symbols for when you need and identifier like configuration options

* Strings for when you are dealing with text or data

## Arrays, Hashes, and Sets - How to use

* List of values ? Array

* Mapping of objects ? Hash

* Large list uniqueness ? Set
